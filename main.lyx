Buyer-side gender discrimination in bargaining:
 evidence from seed sales in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Haggling over prices is a common feature of economic transactions in many societies.
 This study examines whether the gender of the seller influences buyers' negotiation strategies and outcomes in bilateral price bargaining.
 Using a bargaining experiment in eastern Uganda,
 we analyze interactions between smallholder maize farmers and either a male or female seed seller.
 Our findings reveal that buyers negotiating with female sellers are less likely to accept the initial offer price and respond with lower counter-bids compared to those bargaining with male sellers.
 Negotiations also last,
 on average,
 one round longer when the seller is a woman,
 and final transaction prices are nearly 9 percent lower.
 These results are particularly relevant for rural economies,
 where restrictive gender norms limit women's financial autonomy.
 Given that small agribusinesses often provide one of the few viable income-generating opportunities for women,
 gender biases in market interactions can have substantial implications for economic empowerment and household welfare.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many contexts,
 price bargaining is the norm rather than the exception.
 The strategies used and the final transaction price depend on various factors,
 including perceptions of purchasing power,
 power dynamics,
 and assumed preferences.
 If these factors systematically disadvantage female informal vendors,
 gender bias may shape both negotiation strategies and outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study,
 we conduct a bargaining experiment to examine whether a seller’s gender influences buyers' negotiation behavior and outcomes.
 In particular,
 we offer the opportunity to a representative group of smallholder maize farmers to buy a bag of hybrid maize seed.
 A trained enumerator,
 guided by a script implemented on a tablet computer,
 acts as a seller.
 After briefly explaining the virtues of hybrid maize seed to the buyer,
 the seller asks if the buyer wants to buy the seed at an initial offer price.
 If the buyer rejects the offer,
 he or she is encouraged to call out a first counter-bid.
 The algorithm on the tablet then determines if the seller agrees on the counter-bid (depending on whether the difference between the two bids is small enough) or to enter into a second round of negotiations and name a second offer price (which is lower than the previous offer price but higher than the farmer's previous counter-bid).
 This process continues until either the farmer accepts an offer price,
 or the seller is instructed to accept a bid because the difference between last bid price and new offer price is lower than a particular threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the primary focus of this study is the gender of the seller,
 we provide exogenous variation along two dimensions.
 First,
 we assign farmers to either a male or female seller in a non-systematic way.
 This allows us to estimate the causal impact of the seller's gender on bargaining strategies and outcomes.
 Second,
 we randomly assign the initial offer price that the seller (male or female) presents to the farmer,
 allowing us to estimate the causal impact of the initial price level on bargaining strategies and outcomes.
 The addition of the level of the initial offer prices as a secondary experimental factor in our experiment allows us to compare the economic importance two effects.
 Furthermore,
 it enables us to explore potential heterogeneity in the gender effect conditional on initial offer price levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We investigate the effect of the seller's gender (and the initial offer price) on various bargaining strategies used by the buyer,
 as well as on outcomes of the process.
 These include:
 (1) the likelihood that the buyer immediately accepts at the initial offer price (and hence no bargaining takes place);
 (2) the first counter-bid following the initial offer price;
 (3) the likelihood that this first counter-bid is the minimum admissible counter-bid;
 (4) the likelihood that the buyer sticks with the initial counter-bid throughout the bargaining process (that is,
 the buyer plays a non-concessional strategy);
 (5) the number of negotiation rounds before any party accepts;
 (6) the likelihood that the buyer accepts at any point (as opposed to ending negotiations because of convergence);
 and (7) the transaction price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results indicate that buyers are significantly less likely to accept the initial offer when the seller is a woman.
 Negotiations with female sellers result in lower initial counter-bids from buyers and a higher likelihood of starting at the lowest possible bid.
 These negotiations also tend to last longer,
 reflecting greater buyer resistance,
 and ultimately lead to transaction prices that are approximately 9 percent lower than those with male sellers.
 Overall,
 our findings suggest that gender-based disparities emerge early in the negotiation process,
 shaping counter-bids and influencing the trajectory of bargaining interactions,
 highlighting the substantial impact of seller gender on market outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We build on a large number of studies—
based on observational data and field experiments alike—
that find overwhelming evidence of differences in the outcomes of market transactions when minorities (including women) are involved as a transacting party (as compared to cases where all transaction parties come from the majority,

 This unsettling regularity has led to a search for the sources of this apparent discrimination,
 generating an equally large body of research.

 Another well-explored topic is the gender wage gap,
 where women generally earn less than men.
 Potential explanations include differences in initial wage offers (bearing similarities with the initial offer prices in our study) and variations in wage negotiation strategies

 race,

 and that 2) buyers from minority groups receive initial and final offers that are higher than those received by majority groups.
 He further finds that the former type of discrimination (that is,
 buyer-side discrimination) is more pronounced than the latter (seller-side discrimination).

 who observe that women-owned micro-businesses are generally less profitable than male-owned businesses.
 To separate the effect of differences in business characteristics from the gender effect,
 they conduct a field experiment among Indian vegetable sellers where men report earning roughly 50 percent more daily revenue than women.
 In their experiment,
 they keep every business aspect (e.g.,
 location,
 opening hours,
 stock,
 etc.) the same except for the gender of the seller.
 After controlling for supply side factors in this way,
 they find that earnings between male and female vendors do not differ and conclude that there is no buyer-side discrimination.

 on the surface,
 appears similar to ours—
informal vegetable markets in India.
 However,
 a key distinction lies in the nature of market interactions:
 in their setting,
 transactions are typically rapid,
 transactional,

 with little room for negotiation.
 By contrast,
 our experiment explicitly incorporates multi-round bargaining,
 which is common in rural Uganda.
 This difference in interaction structure may help explain the contrasting findings.
 Supporting this,

 argue that when discrimination manifests in the initial counter-offer,
 it likely reflects fixed biases rather than dynamics of the negotiation itself.
 Our study shows that discriminatory behavior emerges early—
via lower initial bids to female sellers—
but also persists through longer and more aggressive bargaining,
 indicating that both the starting point and the trajectory of negotiations are gendered.

In addition to its academic contribution,
 this paper offers important insights from a broader policy perspective.
 In environments shaped by strong gender norms and customs,
 household roles and responsibilities are often divided along gender lines.
 For example,
 men typically engage in economic activities such as maize production,
 while women are responsible for reproductive tasks like fetching water and firewood.
 When women enter income-generating activities,
 they may be perceived less favorably than men,
 facing biases that create unfavorable bargaining dynamics

 Informal vendors are frequently self-employed or women-owned,

 Our findings suggest that these women may face additional challenges in the marketplace:
 even when offering the same product under identical conditions,
 female sellers receive lower offers,
 negotiate longer,
 and ultimately achieve lower prices than their male counterparts—
highlighting how entrenched perceptions can translate into measurable economic disadvantage.

\begin_layout Section
Bargaining Experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies of gender-based discrimination often employ audit studies,
 a research method designed to isolate discrimination by controlling for all factors except the characteristic being tested (in this case,
 gender).
 In these studies,
 the same individual interacts with different counterparts while varying only a key trait—
such as the gender of the person they engage with.
 This approach allows researchers to measure within-subject differences in how people respond to individuals of different genders under otherwise identical circumstances.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While audit studies are well-suited for detecting seller-side discrimination,
 where identical products or services are offered to individuals of different genders,
 they may be less effective for identifying buyer-side discrimination.
 This is because buyers typically make one-time purchases,
 meaning that requiring the same buyer to interact with both male and female sellers could influence their behavior,
 thereby affecting the external validity of the study.
 In real-world settings,
 buyers do not usually face repeated,
 identical purchasing decisions,
 and forcing such interactions within a study may create artificial decision-making patterns that do not reflect typical market behavior.
 As a result,
 a between-subjects design,
 in which different buyers are randomly assigned to interact with either male or female sellers,
 is likely a more appropriate approach.
 This ensures that observed differences in purchasing behavior reflect genuine gender-based discrimination rather than experimental artifacts introduced by repeated exposure to different seller types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our experiment,
 farmers are offered the opportunity to buy a bag of seed from a seller through a bargaining process.
 Compared to a one-shot,
 take-it-or-leave it approach (such as the Becker–DeGroot–Marschak method that is often used to measure willingness to pay,
 as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

),
 a bargaining experiment is more realistic in settings where haggling over prices is the norm.
 An initial offer price is randomly drawn from a set of four prices (UGX12,000,
 11,000,
 10,000,
 and 9,000),
 with higher probability on the extremes (probabilities are 0.3,
 0.2,
 0.2,
 and 0.3 respectively).

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The price at which seed was sold in shops was 12,000.
 As farmers thus receive a discount on the price of seed (unless they draw the highest price and immediately accept),
 we did not offer any additional incentives to participate to farmers.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This price is then presented to the farmer as the price of the bag of seed.
 The seller explains what kind of seed it is and what the advantages are,
 and the farmer is asked if they want to buy the seed for this price.
 If the farmer says no,
 then they are encouraged to name their counter-bid price.
 The minimal bid price was UGX3,000,
 but this lower limit was not communicated to the farmer in advance.
 Only when the farmer's initial counter-bid was lower than 3,000 was it communicated that this was the lowest acceptable price,
 and the farmer could either revise the first counter-bid to 3,000 or above,
 or abandon the game.

To reduce potential bias from tester behaviour,

 'Hello,
 as part of the research project we introduced earlier [during consent],
 we are giving you the opportunity to buy a bag of maize seed of an improved variety to try out in your fields.
 The seed is a popular hybrid variety called Bazooka.
 Bazooka is high yielding,

 You can use cash or mobile money to pay.
 We offer you the seed at [insert randomly selected initial offer price].

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The tablet computer guiding the seller uses an algorithm to determine a counter-offer that the enumerator asks in a second round of negotiation.
 This new offer price is determined as the farmer's bid price plus 80 percent of the difference between the (initial) offer price and the farmer's bid price,
 and this is rounded to the nearest multiple of 500.
 This updated (lower) offer price is then compared to the last bid price of the farmer.
 If the difference is smaller than 500,
 the seller is instructed to accept the bid price.
 If the difference between the updated (lower) offer price and the bid price is larger than 500,
 then the updated offer price is presented to the farmer,
 and the farmer gets a second opportunity to accept or reject.
 If the farmer does not accept,
 the farmer is encouraged to make a second bid that should be equal to or higher than the first bid the farmer made.
 Based on this second bid,
 a third offer price is determined as the farmer's second bid price plus 80 percent of the difference between the second offer price and the farmer's second bid price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bargaining continues in this way until the farmer accepts an offer price,
 or the price difference between the bid and offer price is smaller than 500 Ugandan shilling,
 in which case the computer instructs the enumerator to sell at the last bid price.
 If the highest initial offer price of UGX12,000 was drawn and a farmer sticks to the lowest possible bid price (UGX3,000),
 the program accepts this bid after 10 negotiation rounds.
 Farmers were not informed about the algorithm.
 That is,
 they did not know that the seller would eventually accept even if they stuck to the lowest price.
 We do not expect that farmers would be able to learn about the offer price formation algorithm from a single bargaining experiment,
 and we also made sure that farmers could not communicate with each other by making sure the experiments were run in parallel in villages.
 All parameters in the experiment were informed by extensive testing in the field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment was timed to coincide with the start of the harvest season to ensure high demand for the seed.
 We had a team of 26 enumerators,
 of which 10 were female and 16 were male.
 While a 50-50 split would have resulted in highest statistical power for the comparison we are interested in,
 the fact that we have more men than women does not affect the estimate of the treatment effect which is simply the difference in average outcomes in the group of farmers who were confronted by a male seller and the group that was confronted by the female seller.

The primary focus is on estimating differences in bargaining outcomes and strategies between farmers who were confronted by male sellers and those who faced female sellers.
 To do so,
 we construct an indicator variable of the gender of the seller 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(T_{i}^{g}\right)$
\end_inset

 which takes the value of one if the seller was a woman and zero if it was a man.
 However,
 recall that we also have a second experimental factor—
the initial offer price—
that is crossed into the design.
 We thus also construct an indicator variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(T_{i}^{p}\right)$

The above fully saturated model is the most agnostic specification to estimate parameters in crossed designs.
 However,
 such models with binary treatments essentially split the sample into four treatment cells,
 significantly reducing statistical power as only half of the sample is used for any comparison.
 However,
 by re-specifying the model,
 we can boost power by pooling treatments (comparing buyers that face female sellers to buyers that face male sellers,
 regardless of the level of the initial offer price).
 This is usually done by simply dropping the interaction term in Equation

 this leads to specification bias if the true interaction effect is not zero,

Fortunately,
 there is a way to recover an unbiased estimate of the pooled regression coefficient if we treat the orthogonal factor as a co-variate and control for it by entering it in deviations from its mean (and interact it with the main experimental factor to avoid specification bias).
 Therefore,
 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:price"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 where the effect of the seller's gender 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\beta_{g}^{pooled}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the effect of interest,
 the treatment indicator for a initial offer price is entered in deviation from its mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(T_{i}^{p}-\overline{T^{p}}\right)$
\end_inset

.

y_{i}=\alpha+\beta_{g}^{pooled}T_{i}^{g}+\beta_{p}\left(T_{i}^{p}-\overline{T^{p}}\right)+\beta_{gp}T_{i}^{g}\left(T_{i}^{p}-\overline{T^{p}}\right)+\gamma x_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}\label{eq:price}
\end{equation}

It is important to note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{g}^{pooled}$
\end_inset

 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:price"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 has a slightly different interpretation than 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{g}$
\end_inset

 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:gender"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 While 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{g}$
\end_inset

 is an estimate of the effect of the gender of the seller when the initial price is low,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{g}^{pooled}$
\end_inset

 is a weighted average of the effect of gender of the seller when initial price is low and the effect of gender of the seller when the initial price is high.
 In factorial experiments where the orthogonal factor has a control level,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{g}$
\end_inset

 is likely to be the preferred estimand,
 as this provides the pure treatment effect (in the absence of any other treatment).
 However,
 in our case,
 it may be reasonable to remain agnostic about the initial offer price,
 and so the effect of the gender of the seller averaged over both high and low initial prices may be the appropriate estimand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The initial offer price was included as an experimental factor as a benchmark to which the effect of the seller's gender can be compared to judge economic significance.
 However,
 we also added the randomized starting price to compensate for the fact that we did not do ex-ante power calculations for the gender comparison.
 Adding a treatment that is known to work on an experiment is a strategy sometimes employed in clinical trials to demonstrate that a particular implementation of a design with a given sample size is powered to detect a treatment effect that is at least as as large.
 In our case,
 we argue that being able to replicate an established finding (that the initial offer price affects the entire bargaining process that follows—
see for instance

means that we are powered to detect effects that are at least as large.

Finally,
 as we will be evaluating multiple bargaining strategies and outcomes,
 we will have to account for multiple hypothesis testings.
 To do so,
 we control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) using sharpened two-stage q-values proposed by

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total sample consists of a representative sample of 760 households,
 drawn from 4 districts in southeastern Uganda (Mayuge,
 Kamuli,
 Iganga,
 and Bugiri).
 These districts were chosen because maize is an important crop for both food and cash for smallholder farmers living there.
 In these 4 districts,
 76 villages were randomly selected from a list of all villages,
 with the likelihood of a village being selected proportional to the number of households that live in the village.
 Within each village,
 10 households were randomly selected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enumerators visited these sampled households and asked to speak with the person within the household who generally makes the most decisions related to growing maize and input use,
 such as what type of maize seed to use.
 An appointment was then made with these individuals for a follow-up visit.
 The farmers were told to “bring some small money to this follow-up meeting as there may be an opportunity to buy something
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The follow-up meeting took place at the farmer’s homestead,
 and we did not lose any farmers between the initial visit—
where the primary purpose was to set a date for the interview—
and the actual experiment.
 There were only a few days at most between this invitation and the follow-up interview,
 which included the bargaining experiment.
 During the follow-up meeting,
 individuals participated in the bargaining experiment,
 after which a short survey was administered.
 Since the minimum acceptable price was set very low and farmers were prepared to pay something,
 everyone who took part in the experiment ultimately purchased seed.

Table

\end_inset

 summarizes some characteristics of study participants and their households.
 We find that 85 percent of interviewed individuals were men.
 The average age of the person that participated in the bargaining experiment was about 48 years.
 The sampled households consisted of about 8 people.
 Farmers cultivate maize on plots that are on average about 1.1 acres each.
 Yields on an average plot were about 442 kilograms per acre in the previous agricultural season (
\emph on
Nsambya
\emph default
 of 2022).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A significant share of farmers have experience with improved seed varieties.
 We find that about 40 percent of farmers in our sample used seed of an open pollinated or hybrid variety in the previous season on any of their plots.
 However,
 farmers have less experience with the type of seed that we offer in the bargaining experiment (a type popularly known as 
\emph on
Bazooka
\emph default
).
 Only about 9.5 percent of farmers indicate that they used this type of seed on any of their plots in the previous season.

 with rows 1 and 3 showing difference between treatment condition (respectively the seller being a woman and a high initial offer price) and control (respectively the seller being a man and a low initial offer price;
 corresponding standard errors in brackets below).
 The fifth column also shows the interaction effect.
 Overall,
 with the exception of the gender of the respondent and maybe age,
 we find good overall balance.
 To account for imbalance with respect to the gender of the respondent and age,
 we control for this in Equations

 provides a first graphical impression of the difference in the bargaining process emanating from the gender of the seller.
 The figure shows that the bargaining process is more likely to converge at a low price when the seller is a woman than when the seller is a man.
 When the seller is a woman,
 there is a clear peak in the density around UGX5,000.
 When the seller is a man,
 there is also some bunching around 5,000,
 but the likelihood that the eventual transaction price is around 5,000 does not differ all that much from the likelihood that the negotiation ends up at around 10,000.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom panel shows that the disadvantage of the female seller immediately manifests itself at the start of the negotiation process when the buyer names their first counter-bid after the seller named the initial (randomly assigned) offer price.
 When the seller is man,
 a first counter bid of 5,000 is most likely.
 When the seller is a woman,
 farmers are equally likely to quote the absolute minimum as 5,000.
 As with the first offer price,
 the first counter-bid price is likely to be an important anchoring point for the rest of the negotiation,
 and the gendered effect is likely to affect a range of other outcomes in the bargaining process

We now turn to a more formal analysis of the entire bargaining process by estimating the regression models presented in Section

.
 We consider the following outcomes and strategies to judge impact of the gender of the seller:
 (1) the likelihood that the buyer accepts the initial offer of the seller (and thus no negotiation ensues);
 (2) the counter-bid price that the buyer calls after the initial offer by the seller;
 (3) the likelihood that the initial counter bid is the lowest admissible bid (UGX3,000);
 (4) the likelihood that the buyer sticks to their initial bid;
 (5) the number of negotiation rounds before the buyer accepts or the seller is instructed to accept by the algorithm;
 and (6) the final transaction price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results of the analysis are in Table

 which shows different outcomes and strategies as colums.
 Control group averages (for the subset of buyers that negotiated with a male seller and started from a low initial offer prices of UGX9,000 or 10,000) are in the bottom panel of Table

 Outcomes are in columns as follows:
 Initial Accept:
 is the share of buyers that immediately accept to buy the seed pack at the initial offer price;
 Starting Bid:
 is the initial counter bid in UGX by the buyer following the initial (randomized) offer price of the seller;
 Bottom Price:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a first outcome of interest,
 we see that about 30 percent of buyers immediately buy the seed pack at the initial offer price.
 Interestingly,
 we see that the likelihood that farmers immediately accept decreases significantly when the seller is a woman,
 reducing to only 12 percent.
 As expected,
 the likelihood of accepting immediately also reduced if the initial offer price is high.
 Finally,
 even though there is a small positive interaction effect,
 the chance that the buyer immediately accepts the initial offer when the seller is a women and the initial offer price is high is virtually zero.
 Averaging over initial offer prices,
 the pooled effect amount to an almost 12 percentage point reduction in the likelihood that the initial offer is immediately accepted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having already touched upon the importance of the initial counter-bid in the negotiation process,
 we revisit the first counter-bid of the buyer here (see starting price in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:results_seller-wide"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 The average counter-bid by farmers in response to this initial offer was just over UGX6,000.
 We find a significant reduction in the first bid price when the seller is a woman,
 regardless of whether we look at the estimate of the interacted model or the pooled model,
 as the interaction effect is not significant.
 The effect is also economically significant,
 amounting to only 87 percent of the initial bid price that male sellers are confronted with.
 This suggests systematic gender-based differences in bargaining behavior,
 where buyers push harder for lower prices when negotiating with women.
 For this outcome,
 there is no significant impact from the initial price level.
 Apparently,
 buyers do not anchor their first counter-offer on the starting price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also find that about 17 percent of buyers started negotiating from UGX3,000,
 the lowest possible counter-bid.
 In line with the previous finding,
 we see that the share of buyers going for the lowest possible counter-bid is significantly higher if the seller is a woman.
 However,
 this is only the case for the pooled regression model,
 that increases statistical power by combining the positive but insignificant gender effect of the low initial price group with the positive but insignificant gender effect of the high initial price group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another interesting negotiation strategy some buyers seem to use is to name an initial counter-bid and stick to this price.
 A surprisingly large share of farmers (40 percent) use this strategy.
 We find that a significantly lower share of farmers use this strategy when the woman is a seller.
 Apparently,
 the fact that female sellers tend to start with lower initial offers provides buyers with more room for upward movement in price.
 This lower anchor could make buyers more willing to adjust their bids upward over time,
 as they may see the negotiation as having more flexibility.
 The effect is virtually equal to the effect of a high initial offer price,
 where the higher range between the initial offer price and the lowest possible counter bid also seems to provide buyers with more room for upward movement in price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The average negotiation took almost 5 rounds before the buyer agreed or the difference between the last bid and the last offer was smaller than the threshold at which the seller was instructed to agree.
 We find that negotiation increases to about 7 rounds if the seller started with a high initial offer price.
 The significant and positive effect is not surprising given that sellers follow a concessional script where the steps are a direct function of the initial offer price.
 More interestingly,
 when the seller is a woman,
 this adds an additional round to the negotiation process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that female sellers face an additional round of bargaining seems to suggest that farmers who negotiate with a woman are less likely to agree with an offer price.
 We thus look at the share of negotiations that were concluded with the buyer agreeing (as opposed to instances where the negotiations ended because the difference between offer price and bid price was less than UGX500).
 While in about 40 percent of cases the buyer eventually accepts,
 this percentage is almost 12 percentage points lower when the seller is a woman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 we look at what is arguably the most important outcome.
 The average transaction price was about UGX7,000,
 which was about 70 percent of the maximum initial offer price,
 and 2.3 times the minimum bid price.
 If the seller is a woman,
 we see that the transaction price is about UGX630 to UGX640 lower than when the seller is a man.
 An initially high offer price increases the final price by UGX328.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Together,
 these results show a clear and substantial effect emanating from the seller's gender.
 The effect originates early in the bargaining process,
 with a lower first counter-bid and a higher share of buyers that start off at the lowest possible bid price when the seller is a woman.
 This lower bound appears to serve as an anchor for subsequent strategies—
with buyers less likely to accept and hence more negotiation rounds—
eventually leading to a significantly lower price at which the transaction takes place.

 and Conclusion

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper,
 we examined the potential consequences of gender-related discrimination on market transactions.
 Specifically,
 we tested whether the gender of seed sellers had an impact on seed buyers' negotiation strategies and eventual outcomes in bilateral price negotiations.
 This was done through a bargaining experiment in eastern Uganda,
 where a representative sample of smallholder maize farmers were given the opportunity to bargain over a bag of maize seed of an improved variety from either a male or female seller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find evidence of systematic gender disparities in bargaining strategies used by buyers.
 In particular,
 we find that buyers negotiate more aggressively with female sellers,
 making lower initial counter-bids,
 extending negotiations by an additional round,
 and ultimately agreeing less often.
 This translates into a transaction price that was almost 10 percent lower when the seller is a women.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As is typically the case,
 our experiment merely demonstrates the presence of discrimination,
 but it does not provide insight into its nature.
 In the literature,
 a distinction is generally made between discrimination that involves some kind of animus on the one hand and statistical discrimination on the other.
 While in the former case there is some kind of general distaste for minorities or a 
\begin_inset Quotes qld

\end_inset

 of discrimination 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1111/1468-0297.00080"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 in the latter case the apparent discrimination is simply the result of market actors using average group characteristics as a proxy of reservation value.
 There are some studies that look into the behavioral mechanisms behind (statistical) gender discrimination,
 often in the context of ultimatum games.
 We distill three interconnected mechanisms:
 perceived negotiation strength,
 implicit biases and social norms,
 and strategic responses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First,
 buyers may perceive female sellers as weaker negotiators,
 leading them to push for lower prices and resist concessions.
 Evidence from ultimatum game experiments suggests that both male and female participants demand more from female proposers and offer less to female respondents,
 reinforcing the notion that women are seen as less assertive in bargaining settings 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "solnick2001gender"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally,
 gender differences in bargaining persistence have been documented,
 with female sellers being less likely to walk away from negotiations,
 further reinforcing buyers’ strategic advantage 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "garcia2012gender"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second,
 implicit biases against female sellers may be rooted in broader societal norms that position men as dominant in economic transactions.
 The meta-analysis by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "oosterbeek2004cultural"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 highlights that bargaining behavior varies significantly across cultures,
 with respondents adjusting their acceptance and rejection behavior based on contextual expectations.
 In societies where women have historically been underrepresented in commercial negotiations,
 buyers may (subconsciously) view them as less authoritative or credible,
 leading to more aggressive bargaining tactics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third,
 even in the absence of overt bias,
 buyers may engage in strategic behavior that disadvantages female sellers.
 Research on framing effects in ultimatum games suggests that men are more sensitive to how offers are presented,
 with different physiological and decision-making responses depending on whether they perceive an interaction as a "gain" or a "loss" (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sarlo2013framing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 If buyers interpret negotiations with female sellers as an opportunity to "gain" more favorable terms—
perhaps due to an expectation that women will concede more readily—
they may push harder for lower prices.
 Furthermore,
 since female sellers tend to start with lower initial offers,
 buyers may perceive greater flexibility in the negotiation,
 making them less likely to commit to their initial bids.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study has several limitations.
 One limitation of the study is potential bias from tester behavior.
 For instance,
 it could be that male sellers bargain harder than female sellers.
 Confounding by tester behavior is a known problem in audit studies that involve actual people in the transactions,
 and a reason why correspondence studies (where personal contact is avoided,
 such as in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.1257/0002828042002561"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 study,
 where CVs of imaginary job candidates with white and non-white sounding names are sent to potential employers to screen on discrimination) are preferred.
 We tried to mitigate this problem by instructing our enumerators to strictly stick to a script on the tablet computer.
 However,
 we cannot completely rule out the fact that male sellers behaved differently during the field experiment than their female counterparts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second limitation lies in the fact that,
 for logistical consideration,
 we did not randomize the seller's gender ex-ante.
 Sellers were sent to farmers based on who was available (hence the larger group where the seller was a man).
 While supervisors were instructed not to assign enumerators to farmers in a systematic fashion,
 we do find that women sellers had a significantly higher probability of being paired with women buyers than male sellers.
 To account for this,
 we include the gender of the buyer as a control variable in the regression model.
 We further looked at balance on a range of characteristics (such as age,
 education level,
 etc.) between farmers that were paired to male and female sellers and generally found no significant differences.
 That said,
 we cannot completely rule out that sellers and buyers were matched on some other (unobservable) characteristics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third,
 our study population may not be representative for real-life situations.
 For instance,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.2307/25098677"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 works with subjects that endogenously select into the market and likely have previous experience in the transactions he is studying.
 In our case,
 it may be that participants have never bought seed in the past and did not intend to do so in the near future.
 Furthermore,
 it is not common for seed sellers to approach potential buyers at their homes;
 normally farmers would go to agro-input shops to buy seed.
 Our study should therefore be regarded as somewhere in-between an experimental study in a lab environment where certain behavioral patterns and roles are endogenously imposed on study subjects and studies that observe actual individual behaviour in an existing market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fourth,
 our study does not look at heterogeneity in bias.
 One obvious source of heterogeneity in this context would be the gender of the buyer,
 as gender homophily effects have been found in a wide range of interactions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "facd5bfb-620b-3f71-8412-0c6d4aa71a2e"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 If we consider the gender of the buyer,
 we see that the reduction in both initial and transaction prices due to the seller being a woman is largest for female buyers.
 This suggests that female buyers appear to be even more biased than men.
 However,
 the difference is insignificant,
 and the parameter estimate is likely to suffer from small sample size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In sum,
 our study contributes to the growing literature on gender-based price discrimination by providing a crucial counterpart to existing audit studies,
 which predominantly show that women pay higher prices as buyers.
 We demonstrate that women also receive lower prices as sellers,
 revealing a “double penalty” in market interactions.
 This two-sided disadvantage underscores the structural barriers women may face in economic transactions.
 Additional research is needed to investigate how this could affect gender inequality in income and financial autonomy of women.
