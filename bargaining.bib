abstract = {Relying on a commonly used fixed-offer bargaining script we examine gender differences in bargaining outcomes in a highly competitive and frequently used market: the taxi market in Lima, Peru. Our bargaining script secures that only the seller can change prices and terminate negotiations, thus we are able to examine differences in the seller's entire path of negotiation and in the reservation price at which they are willing to trade. We find that male and female passengers who use the same bargaining script are not treated equally. Men face higher initial prices, final prices, and rejection rates. These differences are consistent with male drivers being more reluctant to give-in to demanding negotiations by male passengers, and with male passengers being perceived as having high valuations. To identify whether taste-based or statistical discrimination drives the inferior treatment of men we conduct an experiment where passengers send a signal on valuation before negotiating. The signal eliminates gender differences and the response is shown only to be consistent with statistical discrimination. Thus in the limiting case of a highly competitive market with experienced traders, we do not find evidence of taste-based discrimination, the differential observed is however consistent with statistical discrimination.}

  abstract = {Abstract We examine smallholder farmers’ willingness to pay for agricultural technology and whether information is a constraint to adoption of certified maize seed in Northern Uganda. The uptake of improved maize varieties by smallholder farmers in Uganda remains persistently low, despite the higher yield potential compared to traditional varieties. A recently growing body of literature identifies information constraints as a potential barrier to adoption of agricultural technologies. We used incentive compatible Becker-DeGroot-Marschak auctions to elicit willingness to pay for quality assured improved maize seed by 1,009 smallholder farmers, and conducted a randomised evaluation to test the effect of an information intervention on farmers’ knowledge of seed certification. Our results show that the randomised information treatment enhanced farmers’ knowledge of certified seed. However, using the information treatment as an instrumental variable for knowledge, we find no evidence of a causal effect of knowledge on willingness to pay, suggesting that even though farmers are information constrained, this constraint does not affect adoption of certified seed directly. Nevertheless, only 14\% of sampled farmers were willing to pay the market price, which corresponds closely with actual observed demand for certified seed in the previous season. This suggests that there are other barriers to adoption than information and awareness.},

  abstract  = {Empirical studies have provided evidence that discrimination exists in various markets, but they rarely allow the analyst to draw conclusions concerning the nature of discrimination. By combining data from bilateral negotiations in the sportscard market with complementary field experiments, this study provides a framework that amends this shortcoming. The experimental design, which includes data gathered from more than 1100 market participants, provides sharp findings: (i) there is a strong tendency for minorities to receive initial and final offers that are inferior to those received by majorities, and (ii) overall, the data indicate that the observed discrimination is not due to animus, but represents statistical discrimination.},

  abstract = { Gender differences in negotiation are seen as contributing to the persistent gender gaps in labor market outcomes. We review the literature on interventions aiming to mute differences in negotiation and assess their effectiveness in reducing the gender pay gap. We present research on initiatives that aspire to increase how often and how women negotiate, as well as institutional changes that ban negotiations, ban requests for employee salary history, and improve wage transparency. Along with reviewing evidence on the effectiveness of these initiatives, we point to unintended consequences that warrant caution at implementation. The review makes clear that initial efforts to push women to negotiate more like men have shifted to alter instead the conditions of the negotiation. This shift results not only from wanting to consider policies that “fix the institutions” rather than “fixing the women,” but also from evidence that these interventions are more successful in securing pay equity. },

  abstract = {Rapid urban growth is straining infrastructures, economies, and food security of cities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Amid competing issues of sanitation, housing, and unemployment, planning for urban food security receives less attention. Despite the proliferation of supermarkets in SSA, informal food vendors remain crucial sources of food for the majority of households. However, as cities grow and planners try to adapt, these informal vendors are generally left out of planning considerations, marginalized by policies that do not support this business model, or subjected to political vicissitudes. This paper analyzes how vendors in emerging cities are economically, socially, and spatially integrated within the urban food system, highlighting the assets these vendors represent and the ways they might support growth in cities. We map vendors’ networks of food suppliers, and describe sources of operating capital and labor assets to show the range of services vendors utilize and the types of institutions, businesses, and individuals that vendors use to support their work. We spatially analyze the relationship between vendors and suppliers, and between vendors and households, to demonstrate how enmeshed these vendors are in the broader food system and the links they create between consumers and suppliers. We demonstrate that due to spatial differences and vendors’ and consumers’ needs in emerging cities, a one-size-fits-all approach for integration of informal vendors in the food system is less likely to be successful in terms of either economic development or household food security.},

  abstract = {Summary Motivation Faced by imperfect information about the performance of value chain actors, transactions are often based on perceptions. Inaccurate perceptions may result in inefficient value chains. Biased perceptions, especially about women, may affect inclusiveness. Purpose We aim to compare perceptions by farmers, input dealers, traders, and processors in Uganda's maize value chain. Specifically, we compare ratings given by farmers to self-ratings of dealers, traders and processors. We test if male farmers rate others differently as compared to female farmers; if men and women rate themselves differently; and whether female farmers rate female value chain actors more highly by virtue of being of the same gender (homophily). Methods and approach A random sample of 1526 small-scale farmers growing maize from the Eastern region in Uganda were asked to rate agro-input dealers, traders, and processors by ease of access, quality of services, price competitiveness, and reputation. These value chain actors—78 agro-input dealers, 341 assembly traders, and 174 processors—were then asked to assess themselves. Descriptive analysis, t-tests, and multivariate regression with two-way non-nested clustering were used for the analysis. Findings We find that input dealers, traders, and processors rate themselves more highly than farmers rate them. For self-assessments, the gender of the value chain actor does not matter. Female farmers tend to rate the dealers, traders, and processors more highly than male farmers do. The sex of the actor rated does not affect the rating they receive; we also find no signs that women rate women more highly than they rate men. Policy implications It is reassuring to see that in Eastern Uganda, women as dealers, traders, and processors were not rated lower than their male counterparts. It was equally reassuring to see that dealers, traders, and processors were rated well for quality by farmers—a frequent concern in Uganda is that they provide poor service. They did not score so well, however, for competitive prices. Policies to encourage competition and new entrants may help. That dealers, traders, and processors rate themselves more highly than farmers do, could lead to complacency, in turn hindering investment and innovation. The gap in perceptions might be reduced if there were certification by an independent agency, or if farmer ratings were crowd sourced.},
